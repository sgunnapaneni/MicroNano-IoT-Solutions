Together, these studies emphasize the importance of theoretical research in informing practical applications and addressing challenges associated with service-oriented architectures.</p>\n          </div>\n      </section>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Content;\n"],"mappings":"AAAA,MAAO,CAAAA,KAAK,KAAM,OAAO,CACzB,MAAO,eAAe,CAAC,OAAAC,GAAA,IAAAC,IAAA,CAAAC,IAAA,IAAAC,KAAA,yBAEvB,KAAM,CAAAC,OAAO,CAAGA,CAAA,GAAM,CACpB,mBACID,KAAA,YAAAE,QAAA,eACIJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,SAAO,CAAI,CAAC,cAEhBF,KAAA,QAAAE,QAAA,eACIJ,IAAA,WAAAI,QAAA,CAAQ,2DAAyD,CAAQ,CAAC,cAC1EJ,IAAA,QAAK,CAAC,cACNE,KAAA,OAAAE,QAAA,eACIJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,wHAEJ,CAAI,CAAC,cACLJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,iFAA+E,CAAI,CAAC,cACxFJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,oIAEJ,CAAI,CAAC,EACL,CAAC,cACLJ,IAAA,MAAAI,QAAA,CAAG,+jBAEH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJJ,IAAA,MAAAI,QAAA,CAAG,okBACH,CAAG,CAAC,EACH,CAAC,cAENF,KAAA,QAAAE,QAAA,eACIJ,IAAA,WAAAI,QAAA,CAAQ,6DAA2D,CAAQ,CAAC,cAC5EJ,IAAA,QAAK,CAAC,cACNE,KAAA,OAAAE,QAAA,eACIJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,oIAEJ,CAAI,CAAC,cACLJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,yHAEJ,CAAI,CAAC,cACLJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,sHAEJ,CAAI,CAAC,EACL,CAAC,cACLJ,IAAA,MAAAI,QAAA,CAAG,ijBAEW,CAAG,CAAC,cACJJ,IAAA,MAAAI,QAAA,CAAG,0nBAEH,CAAG,CAAC,EACjB,CAAC,cAENF,KAAA,QAAAE,QAAA,eACIJ,IAAA,WAAAI,QAAA,CAAQ,oEAAkE,CAAQ,CAAC,cACnFJ,IAAA,QAAK,CAAC,cACNE,KAAA,OAAAE,QAAA,eACIJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,uFAEJ,CAAI,CAAC,cACLJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,6EAEJ,CAAI,CAAC,cACLJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,0GAEJ,CAAI,CAAC,EACL,CAAC,cACLJ,IAAA,MAAAI,QAAA,CAAG,8dACH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJJ,IAAA,MAAAI,QAAA,CAAG,6hBAAwhB,CAAG,CAAC,EAC9hB,CAAC,cAENF,KAAA,QAAAE,QAAA,eACIJ,IAAA,WAAAI,QAAA,CAAQ,sEAAoE,CAAQ,CAAC,cACrFJ,IAAA,QAAK,CAAC,cACNE,KAAA,OAAAE,QAAA,eACIJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,oGAEJ,CAAI,CAAC,cACLJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,6EAEJ,CAAI,CAAC,cACLJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,+FAEJ,CAAI,CAAC,EACL,CAAC,cACLJ,IAAA,MAAAI,QAAA,CAAG,yaAEH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJJ,IAAA,MAAAI,QAAA,CAAG,olBAEH,CAAG,CAAC,EACH,CAAC,cAENF,KAAA,QAAAE,QAAA,eACIJ,IAAA,WAAAI,QAAA,CAAQ,kFAAgF,CAAQ,CAAC,cACjGJ,IAAA,QAAK,CAAC,cACNE,KAAA,OAAAE,QAAA,eACIJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,gFAEJ,CAAI,CAAC,cACLJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,sFAEJ,CAAI,CAAC,cACLJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,oFAEJ,CAAI,CAAC,EACL,CAAC,cACLJ,IAAA,MAAAI,QAAA,CAAG,qZAEL,CAAG,CAAC,cACJJ,IAAA,MAAAI,QAAA,CAAG,kiBAEH,CAAG,CAAC,EACD,CAAC,cAENF,KAAA,QAAAE,QAAA,eACIJ,IAAA,WAAAI,QAAA,CAAQ,4DAA0D,CAAQ,CAAC,cAC3EJ,IAAA,QAAK,CAAC,cACNE,KAAA,OAAAE,QAAA,eACIJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,+FAEJ,CAAI,CAAC,cACLJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,0GAEJ,CAAI,CAAC,cACLJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,uFAEJ,CAAI,CAAC,EACL,CAAC,cACLJ,IAAA,MAAAI,QAAA,CAAG,ucACH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJJ,IAAA,MAAAI,QAAA,CAAG,4iBAAuiB,CAAG,CAAC,EAC7iB,CAAC,cAENF,KAAA,QAAAE,QAAA,eACIJ,IAAA,WAAAI,QAAA,CAAQ,6CAA2C,CAAQ,CAAC,cAC5DJ,IAAA,QAAK,CAAC,cACNE,KAAA,OAAAE,QAAA,eACIJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,qEAEJ,CAAI,CAAC,cACLJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,uFAEJ,CAAI,CAAC,cACLJ,IAAA,OAAAI,QAAA,CAAI,yHAEJ,CAAI,CAAC,EACL,CAAC,cACLJ,IAAA,MAAAI,QAAA,CAAG,gZACH,CAAG,CAAC,cACJJ,IAAA,MAAAI,QAAA,CAAG,mYAAiY,CAAG,CAAC,EACvY,CAAC,EACD,CAAC,CAEhB,CAAC,CAED,cAAe,CAAAD,OAAO","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
